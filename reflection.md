- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
It helped me organize my thinking before I even began to code, by understanding better what parts of my code would rely on what. It also helped me simplfy my code by realizing that I could take advantage of asssociation to link together different classes and methods. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was debugging early, and not coding through red squiggly lines, this made my code much cleaner. Adivce I would give is to test more and test as early as possible, do not wait until the end to test code!!!
